# Welcome To My Silly Little Texture Pack!

This is a little project I'm doing to keep myself busy when I have nothing to do, and it contains some little faces that I think turned out quite well!

I'm making little steps to improve compatibility for mods that modify/increase the number of faces in the game (Although it may take a while)

# If Not Using Geode

Download the texture sheets and replace the relevant ones in the "Resources" folder of your Geometry Dash

# If Using Geode

Download these mods:
  - "Texture Loader" by Geode Team
  - "Texture Workshop" by Uproxide

This texture pack is included in the Texture Workshop (Although it may be an older version of the pack) so you can download it there to save some hassle!

# Compatible Mods

  - "More Difficulties" by Uproxide

# Roadmap

  - "Godlike Faces" support
  - "Grandpa Demon" support
  - "GDDP Integration" support
  - "Fake Rate" support
  - "Demons Inbetween" support
