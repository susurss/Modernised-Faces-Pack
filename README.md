**If not using Geode:**

To use the texture pack, simply download the texture sheets and replace the relevant ones in the "Resources" folder of your Geometry Dash! After doing this, you will see the faces in all their glory!

**If using Geode:**

Download these mods:
  - "Texture Loader" by Geode Team
  - "Texture Workshop" by Uproxide

This texture pack is included in the Texture Workshop (Although it may be an older version of the pack) so you can download it there to save some hassle!
